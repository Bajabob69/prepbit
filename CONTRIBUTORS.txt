#Contributor instructions

#If you decide to contribute or change the code in anyway please update the readme.md file. 

#If you decide to contribute please create a User role in the very bottom section of the readme. The 
#user role will be used in the readme to identify the contributor who made any changes and what changes they made. 
#The user role must be all capitals and placed within <> or () and then followed either by a user id or a name. 
#The usual role does nothing more than identify the person who made the changes. 

#If your changes require more than a few lines please use your favorite text editor to create a .prep file in the 
#contributions folder and include your user role. 

#Thank you for help!

#This is only for contributors. If you wish to use the available resources i have compiled or the code please use the #Template option and pull everything into your own repo. Thank you!
