#Contributor instructions

If you decide to contribute or change the code in anyway please update the readme.md file. 

If you decide to contribute please create a User role in the very bottom section of the readme. The 
user role will be used in the readme to identify the contributor who made any changes and what changes they made. 
The user role must be all capitals and placed within <> or () and then followed either by a user id or a name. 
The usual role does nothing more than identify the person who made the changes. 

If your changes require more than a few lines please use your favorite text editor to create a .prep file in the 
contributions folder and include your user role. 

Thank you for help!
