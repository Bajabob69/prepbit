# prepbit

Still a work in progress. 

prepbit is a solution package to the worlwide question of "What happens to the internet when the world ends?" The answer is simple. The nerds take over. 

prepbit is easily customizable, designed with only the simplest of codes, and will have everything from tutorials to entertainment. Still in the process of getting others to help contribute. If you are interested feel free to get a pull request. I only ask that you keep the code simplistic. Try not to inlcude any kind of Perl, PHP, Ruby on Rails, CoffeeScript, or anything that requires server side includes, CGI, or extended server software. I would also prefer to keep from having to use MySQL as well. If databases are used we can always use json database scheming.  Thank you. 

*NOTE* It may seem that I don't know how to type or write correctly but the name prepbit is designed to be all lower case. Still working on a design for it.
